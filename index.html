                    <h2>Hi, nice to meet you! </h2>
                    <p>I'm located in Marriottsville, Maryland (DMV).</p>
                    <p>I'm currently a student studying to become a web developer.</p>

                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Personally, from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, I am constantly using technology. With myself being so immersed, I can't help but wonder how all these things work. I hope to one day be on the producer side of the tech industry, to make life more convenient and enjoyable.</p>
                <p>From watching and playing sports, I realized the emphasis of teamrwok. A team can accomplish significantly more than one a single person can. In the extremely complicated and hairy field of programming, I believe that teamwork can help alleviate these issues. Iâ€™m looking forward to meeting and working with you!</p>
                <p>As a person, I have other interests outside of just coding. Feel free if you want to talk about hip hop, video games, TV shows, and movies.</p>
                <p>The services I can provide for you are web development.</p>
